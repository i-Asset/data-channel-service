**ServiceID**: java-microservice-example

Example implementation for a microservice written in Java and the Spring Boot framework.
  
## Configuration

Base configuration can be found at src/main/resources/application.properties and bootstrap.yml.
[Spring Cloud Config](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/) is used for central configuration management. A central configuration is hosted on [https://github.com/nimble-platform/cloud-config](https://github.com/nimble-platform/cloud-config)
and injected during startup.

## Swagger

The Example API is designed using the [swagger.io editor](http://editor.swagger.io) (file: src/main/resources/api.yml) and the code generator for the Spring framework. 
The Maven plugin (swagger-codegen-maven-plugin) is used to generate defined interfaces automatically in each Maven build.
